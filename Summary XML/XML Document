$$ Documents Nodes:
    A Document node is a complete document, including the XML Declaration. All XML documents
    may (and should!) begin with a single XML declaration.
    The document root of each XML document is also the point of attachment for the document's
    description using a DTD or Schema.

$$ Document fragments:
    A document fragment is a part of a document that might or might not be well formed. It
    can be a group of elements with no root element.

$$ Document types:
    An XML document may contain a DOCTYPE declaration. It contains information that tells the
    processor about the Document Type Definition (DTD). The first argument refers to the root
    element of the XML document. These two must match because the DTD can describe only specific
    structures.
    Example: DocTypeExample.xml

$$ Document types - PUBLIC:
    The PUBLIC identifier is used to reference a DTD.
    Example: DocTypePublicExample.xml

$$ Document types - SYSTEM:
    An XML parser may try to generate a URI using the PUBLIC identifier. If it is unable eo do so,
    the SYSTEM identifier may be used.
    Example: DocTypeSystemExample.xml
